# implement-CNN-at-Kannada-MNIST

Convolutional neural network -- CNN is good at picture processing. It's inspired by the human visual nervous system.

CNN has two major characteristics:
1. It can effectively reduce the dimensionality of large data into small data;
2. Can effectively retain the characteristics of the picture, in line with the principles of image processing

At present, CNN has been widely used.
Because convolutional neural networks have been applied to MNIST handwritten digit datasets for various experiments, I use the Kannada hand-written dataset . Kannada is the official administrative language of Karnataka, India, and is spoken by nearly 60 million people worldwide. Different symbols are used to represent the numbers 0-9 in the language, which are different from the modern Arabic numerals popular in many parts of the world today. Unlike the MNIST handwritten digit dataset, Kannada's replacement of MNIST adds a new challenge to the CNN experiment.
